# Module 5 Ethical Considerations and Future Trends

## Lesson 24 Responsible AI

As AI becomes more powerful and shifts to generative, concerns of misuse and discrimination is also increasing.

AI does make mistakes:

* Recruitment systems showing gender bias
* Image recognition systems ignoring images of people of color
* Chatbots using hate speech
* GenAI cited non-existent legal data
* Privacy breaches

**Responsible AI** is the ethical and moral framework that guiddes the devleopment, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence systems to ensure that they align with human values and societal norms.

Responisble AI is needed to prevent:

* Bias and Discrimination

  Is the training model receiving balanced input? Gender inequality can occur if the model is shown more examples (resumes) of men than women.
* Privacy concerns

  Can't use real financial data, medical data, etc. for training the model without consent. On the output side, there is fake info including images, etc.
  
* Legal consequences

  How do we know if AI is doing something illegal?

* Loss of trust

  Since AI processing can be so complex, how do we know that the generated info is correct?

### How to implement responsible AI
Incorporate Responsible AI in the development of AI system, include GenAI systems.

* Incorporate ethical AI principles into all aspects of your company
* Data quality should be true, diverse
* Transparency regarding the algorithm. How does it work and should it be altered?
* Consent regarding data and compliance with laws and such
* Monitor and improve 
* Human involvement

## Lesson 25 Future Trends

GenAI will advance and the adoption of it will increase. It is predicted that 80 percent of enterprises will use GenAI by 2026. In 2023, it was only 5 percent.

* GenAI is evolving at a rapid pace.
* Moving from ideas to implementation.
* Shift to smaller, targeted, industry-specific models (15-40 million parameter).
* Multimodal AI fusion for image, videos, and audio generation.
* Responsible and regulated AI

### Will GenAi replace human jobs?
 
 No, not entirely but
 * Skill shift and new job opportunities
 * More impact on white color work, not blue
 * Greatest impact on customer operations, legal, marketing/sales, software engineering, and R&D
 * Increase in human productivity

 We need to learn GenAI and start using it. It augments us, helping us to do our jobs faster, more easily, and with quality.

 AI won't replace humans but humans with AI skills will replace humans without AI skills.
